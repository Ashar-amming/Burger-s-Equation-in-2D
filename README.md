Burgers' Equation in 2D serves as an excellent model problem in CFD for testing and developing numerical methods due to its balance of nonlinearity and diffusive effects. While it is much simpler than the Navier-Stokes equations, it retains enough complexity to challenge computational methods, particularly in the presence of shocks or steep gradients.
